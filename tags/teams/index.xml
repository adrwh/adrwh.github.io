      <description>We use Microsoft Teams, and probably as most, create a new team when it was first released, however have now decided to move to a new Team. This is all fine, but when we went looking for a &amp;ldquo;migration&amp;rdquo; pathway, there wasn&#39;t one. Instead we settled on making a backup/copy for historical purposes.
I went searching PowerShell for cmdlets to &amp;ldquo;backup&amp;rdquo; Teams and didn&#39;t find any. I then went searching the Microsoft Graph API and found the Teams API resources.</description>
